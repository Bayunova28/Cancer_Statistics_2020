## Context
<p align=justify>Cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their 
usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 
9.6 million deaths, or one in six deaths, in 2018. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, 
colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women.</p>
